# GTT + HPE — Strategic Use Case Tool

A single-page, self-contained HTML tool. Two industry use cases (QSR retail, global
manufacturing) built on the GTT + HPE Unified SASE blueprint, with ICPs, a
"Why GTT + HPE" differentiation section, and an internal sales play.

## What's in this folder

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | The entire tool. This is the deliverable. |
| `package.json` | Tells Railway how to serve the page. |
| `railway.json` | Pins the start command for Railway. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

There is **no build step** and **no database**. It is one static page.

## Option A — Just review it locally (no deploy)

Double-click `index.html`. It opens in your browser and everything works —
tabs, fonts, links (links open in a new tab). This needs no GitHub and no Railway.

---

## Option B — Deploy on Railway for a shareable review link

### 1. Put it on GitHub
- Create a new repository (e.g. `gtt-hpe-use-cases`).
- Upload all four files in this folder to the repo root
  (GitHub.com → "Add file" → "Upload files" → drag them in → Commit).

### 2. Deploy on Railway
- Railway → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick the repo.
- Railway auto-detects Node, installs `serve`, and runs the start command.
- When it finishes, open **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain**.
- That public URL is your review link — it renders the page exactly as built.

### 3. (Optional) Use it as a Microsoft Teams tab
- In a Teams channel: **+ (Add a tab) → Website →** paste the Railway URL.
- It renders inline, pixel-perfect, fonts and all.

## Notes for reviewers

- **Fonts** load from Google Fonts over the internet. On Railway (a normal public
  host) they resolve fine. Inside some locked-down corporate environments the page
  may fall back to system fonts — that's the environment, not the file.
- **Content provenance** is documented in the tool's own footer ("Sources &
  provenance"): green = sourced from GTT/HPE material, purple = Solution
  Architecture (original strategic work needing claims-owner review).
- The two customer scenarios are **industry archetypes**, not specific accounts.
